# Energy-Free Step Counting using Photovoltaic Sensors

This repository contains the implementation of an **energy-free step counting system** based on the research published on **arXiv**:  

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project explores how **photovoltaic (solar) cells** can be used as **sensors** for detecting steps in a power-efficient manner. The system leverages variations in light intensity detected by foot-mounted solar cells to recognize step patterns, ensuring **accurate step counting without the need for external power sources**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Photovoltaic-based sensing** for step detection.
- **Real-time processing** of sensor data.
- **Automatic correction** for missed steps.
- **CSV-based data logging** for further analysis.
